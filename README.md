Data Science Projects Completed in IIITB - PGDDA Program

1. Spark Funds Investment Case Study :
-----------------------------------------------------
The objective is to identify the best sectors, countries, and a suitable investment type for making investments. The overall strategy is to invest where others are investing, implying that the best sectors and countries are the ones where most investments are happening.

2. Gramener Loan Default Case Study :
-----------------------------------------------------
The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 

3. Uber Supply Demand Gap Analysis Case Study :
-----------------------------------------------------
The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) and recommend ways to improve the situation. As a result of your analysis, you should be able to present to the client the root cause(s) and possible hypotheses of the problem(s) and recommend ways to improve them.

4. Car Pricing Case Study :
-----------------------------------------------------
Goal of this case study is to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for the management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

5. HR Analytics Case Study :
-----------------------------------------------------
Goal of the case study is to model the probability of attrition using a logistic regression. The results thus obtained will be used by the management to understand what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay.

6. KNN Implementation for Spark :
-----------------------------------------------------
KNN Algorithm is implemented to analyze performance of Spark and Hadoop.

7. Hackathon Railway Helpdesk Automation :
-----------------------------------------------------
Tried automation of Railway Helpdesk to quickly resolve twitter based queries and complaints using twitter streaming plugin, OpenNLP, MongoDB and Tableau for reporting. 

7. Handwritten Digit Recognition :
-----------------------------------------------------
Developed a model using Support Vector Machine which should correctly classify the handwritten digits based on the pixel values given as features.
